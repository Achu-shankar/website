The project focused on the design and development of a high-endurance mini Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The primary objective was to create a compact and lightweight UAV capable of extended flight durations while maintaining stability and reliability. The design incorporated advanced materials and aerodynamic principles to optimize energy efficiency and endurance.

Key features of the mini UAV included a durable yet lightweight frame, efficient propulsion systems, and a sophisticated power management system to maximize battery life. The UAV's aerodynamic design aimed at minimizing drag and optimizing lift, allowing it to achieve extended flight times without compromising on stability.

Additionally, the project emphasized the integration of cutting-edge technologies for navigation, communication, and data acquisition. The mini UAV was equipped with advanced sensors and imaging devices, making it suitable for various applications such as surveillance, monitoring, and data collection in challenging environments.

Throughout the project, rigorous testing and iterative design processes were employed to fine-tune the UAV's performance and ensure its resilience in diverse operational scenarios. The result was a high-endurance mini UAV that showcased a balance between technological innovation, efficiency, and reliability.
